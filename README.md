# CommieBot

Discord bot written in python

## Requirements:
   - Python 3.6.5
   - discord.py (rewrite version)
   - opencv-python
   - BeautifulSoup
   - numpy
   - sqlite3
   - pillow (outdated)
   - and other miscellaneous Python modules

I learned python, basic discord bot structures, and also borrowed some fun commands from Martlet bot from McGill University server! So thanks a ton to the contributors of Marty.
